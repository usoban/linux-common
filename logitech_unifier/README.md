Logitech Unifier
================

A program to pair devices to a Logitech Unifying Receiver on Linux.

Logitech only provides a Windows program to do this, so if you're running Linux, you either need to pair your 
devices on a windows box or use the unify.c script. 

Quick How To - BETA
----------------

Run:

    ./autopair.sh

This script which will do a bunch of stuff automatically.

- It will automatically compile the binary (if needed)
- mark it executable (if needed)
- find the Logitech device in hidraw
- run the script with additional prompting (turn off device first)

Longer How To if Above Doesn't Work
--------------------------------

1\. Compile it

    gcc -o unify unify.c

2\. Find your hidraw device

To find it, run the following for every hidrawX on your system until you find `HID_NAME=Logitech USB Receiver`:

    cat /sys/class/hidraw/hidraw0/device/uevent
    
If hidraw0 isn't it, try hidraw1 and so on.

3\. Pair it

Run: 

    sudo ./unify /dev/hidrawX

Where X is the matching number from step 2. 

4\. Turn on your device like the tool will say.

That's it!  Device should work now.
